items:
  - name: NOTOC
    documentation: Hides the table of contents (TOC).
  - name: FORCETOC
    documentation: Forces the table of contents to appear at its normal position (before the first header, overriding __NOTOC__). This will not work in skins that present table of contents outside the article content e.g. Vector 2022 skin.
  - name: TOC
    documentation: Places a table of contents at the word's current position (overriding __NOTOC__). If this is used multiple times, the table of contents will appear at the first word's position. This will not work in skins that present table of contents outside the article content e.g. Vector 2022 skin.
  - name: NOEDITSECTION
    documentation: "Hides the section edit links beside headings. This is especially useful where a heading is created from within a template: the normal wiki section-edit would in this case edit the template code, which is usually not what the user intends. Use of this in a template will extend the effect to that template, the pages it's included on, and any other templates included on the same page. A workaround is possible."
  - name: NEWSECTIONLINK
    documentation: Adds a link beside the "Edit" tab for adding a new section on a non-talk page (see Adding a section to the end).
  - name: NONEWSECTIONLINK
    documentation: Removes the link beside the "Edit" tab on pages in talk namespaces.

    documentation: Used on a category page, removes the category from Special:UnusedCategories.
  - name: NOCONTENTCONVERT
    documentation: On wikis with language variants, don't perform any content language conversion (character and phase) in article display; for example, only show Chinese (zh) instead of variants like zh_cn, zh_tw, zh_sg, or zh_hk.
  - name: NOCC

  - name: NOINDEX

  - name: STATICREDIRECT
    documentation: On redirect pages, don't allow MediaWiki to automatically update the link when someone moves a page and checks "Update any redirects that point to the original title" (which requires $wgFixDoubleRedirects).
  - name: NOGLOBAL
    documentation: GlobalUserPage extension required. Disables the global user page. If present on the central user page, will prevent it from being displayed on remote wikis, and it also determines whether a link to a user page on remote wiki should be red or blue.
  - name: DISAMBIG
    documentation: Disambiguator extension required. Identifies a disambiguation page.
  - name: EXPECTED_UNCONNECTED_PAGE
    documentation: Wikibase extension required. Some wiki pages do not merit a Wikidata item, such as discussion archives, template subpages, etc. To prevent a wiki page from being listed in Special:UnconnectedPages, use this magic word anywhere on the page. Pages that don't meet Wikidata's notability criteria should not receive a Wikidata item.
  - name: ARCHIVEDTALK
    documentation: DiscussionTools extension required. Hides "reply" links from discussions on archived pages.
  - name: NOTALK
